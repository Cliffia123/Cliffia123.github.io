<p>During my university years, I won a school scholarship and a national motivational scholarship for three consecutive years, my university's advanced math score is 98 points. I am passionate about image processing, pattern recognition technology, have participated in several research projects and dozens of competitions, and wrote papers as the first author. The paper has been accepted by Computer and Digital Engineering, Chinese core journals.

<h3>Project research</h3>
<h4>School（2016.9~2019.7）</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campus Vehicle Management System Based on Deep Learning</strong><br> The project realized the dynamic detection of the vehicle and the recognition of the license plate characters. The highlight of the project is that it can achieve better detection results in bad weather. After testing, Chinese license plates Recognition accuracy of 87%</li>
<li><strong>Automated detection of bladder tumor based on MRI image</strong><br>I learned about my professor's research in this area, so I applied to participate in the research and set up a team. We studied the medical images of patients and improved them based on the network model U-Net. Automated segmentation, and the use of machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, random forest trees, to detect the tumor period, and finally wrote a paper on this research.</li>
<li><strong>Flaw fabric detection based use faster Rcnn</strong><br>In textile fabrics, the small flaws of manual inspection of clothes are very resource intensive, so our team wants to solve this problem with the current technology and research our solution, which is still under development.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Company(2019.7-now)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Huawei</strong><br>At present, I am an intern at Huawei company and I work as a general software development engineer. Although I have been in contact with work, I still have a great passion for scientific research.At present, I am an intern at Huawei company and I work as a general software development engineer.
