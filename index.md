I am from South China Normal University, majoring in software engineering. I am eager to learn and have the courage to challenge myself. In terms of professionalism, he has obtained school scholarships and national motivational scholarships for two consecutive years. In the subject competition, he participated in more than a dozen provincial-level competitions, large and small, mainly for the direction of mathematics and research projects, and all achieved good results. In the research project, starting from the sophomore year, I started academic research with the tutor of the college. I am passionate about computer vision and natural language processing. I have applied for the innovation and entrepreneurship research project of college students and the gold seed research project of South China Normal University. Write a paper as the first author.

### Project research
#### School（2016.9~2019.7）
- **Automated detection of bladder tumor based on MRI image**  
I learned about my professor's research in this area, so I applied to participate in the research and set up a team. We studied the medical images of patients and improved them based on the network model U-Net. Automated segmentation, and the use of machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, random forest trees, to detect the tumor period, and finally wrote a paper on this research.
- **Campus Vehicle Management System Based on Deep Learning**  
The project realized the dynamic detection of the vehicle and the recognition of the license plate characters. The highlight of the project is that it can achieve better detection results in bad weather. After testing, Chinese license plates Recognition accuracy of 87%The project realized the dynamic detection of the vehicle and the recognition of the license plate characters. The highlight of the project is that it can achieve better detection results in bad weather. After testing, Chinese license plates Recognition accuracy of 87%.

- **Flaw fabric detection based use faster Rcnn**
In textile fabrics, the small flaws of manual inspection of clothes are very resource intensive, so our team wants to solve this problem with the current technology and research our solution, which is still under development.

#### Company(2019.7-now)
- **Huawei**
Currently, I am a software development engineer at Huawei. Although I have been in contact with work, I am still passionate about scientific research. During the internship, get a good internship.
